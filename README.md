# Music-sync-LED-GUI-using-FFT
This is a GUI which stimulates 144 LEDs. Each bar represents one LED and the entire LED strip reacts according to the volume and tempo of the sound. This is done by using the mic of the laptop to take in the audio and use FFT to convert the audio signal into their respective frequencies to generate a continuous wave.
